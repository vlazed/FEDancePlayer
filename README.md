# FE Dance Player


## Usage
Download the FEDancePlayer.lua script, the corresponding rbxm binary from Releases, and an animation pack (provided in this github). Place the binary in your executor's workspace (do not place it inside any directories inside the workspace). Place the fe-dance-anim folder in workspace. Generally, animations go into fe-dance-anim/anims. Run FEDancePlayer.lua to run the script. Note that you only need to download the lua script once since updates only happen on the binary.

- Dance+emote Animations from Club Boates, Midnight Horrors, R6 Dances, Royal Hillcrest, Midnight Horrors. I needed some animations to debug my controllers.
